# Arithmetic Exam Application
Project of Python Core track at hyperskill.org

# About
Many people are fond of interactive learning. In this project, you will learn how to write an application that can facilitate solving arithmetic operations in a quick manner. The application will generate a mathematical expression for a user to solve. Implement various levels of difficulty and let the application save the results and show the progress of learning.
# Learning outcomes
Learn how to handle input and output, employ the random number generator, and write the output to a file.
